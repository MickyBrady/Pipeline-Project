Step 1: Retrieve Transcriptomes from SRA
Overview
For this project, you will retrieve the transcriptomes of two patient donors at 2- and 6-days post-infection (dpi) from the SRA (Sequence Read Archive). These datasets are publicly available on NCBI and will be converted into paired-end FASTQ files for downstream analysis. The four relevant datasets are:

Donor 1 (2dpi): SRX2896360
Donor 1 (6dpi): SRX2896363
Donor 3 (2dpi): SRX2896374
Donor 3 (6dpi): SRX2896375
These files can be retrieved using either the SRA toolkit or wget.
