#Pipeline for Transcriptome Analysis

#Step 1: Retrieving Transcriptomes from SRA and Converting to FASTQ Files

We first retrieve the transcriptomes from SRA (Sequence Read Archive) for the patient donors to begin the analysis pipeline. This step involves downloading the SRA files and converting them to paired-end FASTQ files using `fastq-dump`.
